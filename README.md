## 🎯 Game Rules

1. Two players take turns.
2. On each turn, a player:
   - Rolls the dice as many times as desired. Each roll (except 1) adds to their _current score_.
   - If the player rolls a **1**, they lose their _current score_ and the turn passes to the other player.
   - They can choose to **"Hold"** to add the _current score_ to their _total score_ and end their turn.
3. The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
